/**
 * Represents a single grid square in the map. Each map element has both terrain and an optional
 * structure.
 *
 * The terrain comes in four pieces, as if each grid square was further divided into its own tiny
 * 2x2 grid (north-west, north-east, south-west and south-east). Each piece of the terrain is
 * represented as an int, which is actually a drawable reference. That is, if you have both an
 * ImageView and a MapElement, you can do this:
 *
 * ImageView iv = ...;
 * MapElement me = ...;
 * iv.setImageResource(me.getNorthWest());
 *
 * This will cause the ImageView to display the grid square's north-western terrain image,
 * whatever it is.
 *
 * (The terrain is broken up like this because there are a lot of possible combinations of terrain
 * images for each grid square. If we had a single terrain image for each square, we'd need to
 * manually combine all the possible combinations of images, and we'd get a small explosion of
 * image files.)
 *
 * Meanwhile, the structure is something we want to display over the top of the terrain. Each
 * MapElement has either zero or one Structure} objects. For each grid square, we can also change
 * which structure is built on it.
